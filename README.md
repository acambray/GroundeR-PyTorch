# GroundeR PyTorch Implementation
>*This project is still in development, and so the below description and documentation is also.*

This is a PyTorch implementation of the supervised and unsupervised GroundeR model from [Grounding of Textual Phrases in Images by Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03745).

Requisites:  
\- PyTorch  
\- torchvision  
\- Numpy  
\- PIL  
\- pickle  
\- matplotlib  

Below is a schematic of the exact implementation (and design decisions) of the code in this repository.
